+NX redistribution by X2Go
+-------------------------
+This source tree is a re-distribution of those NX packages needed to
+use and build NX client applications on Linux systems.
+
+The NX re-distribution currently is maintained by the X2Go Project:
+http://wiki.x2go.org
+
+Our goal is: 
+    - provide _one_ tarball that builds NX projects via a common Makefile
+    - provide _one_ tarball for distribution packagers
+
+This re-distribution (client-only version) contains the following tarballs
+derived from NoMachine (http://www.nomachine.com/sources.php):
+
+  nxcomp
+  nxproxy
+
+The patches we apply are shipped with this tarball, for further introspection
+please refer to this folder:
+
+  .applied-patches-on-top-of-NX-upstream
+
+This source tree is maintained on the X2Go Git server:
+Browsing...     http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=nx-libs.git;a=summary
+Git-Cloning...  git clone git://code.x2go.org/nx-libs.git
+
+If you have any questions about this NX redistribution or want to file 
+a bug, then please contact the X2Go developers on
